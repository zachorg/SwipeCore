That I suppose is on us but a. That price is insane and b. Their board is definitely misleading. The thing that really made us mad is when we went up and said never mind on the second hour and the obliged and refunded but they also immediately cut off our lane when we had over 10 minutes left. This place is over priced as it is and now they are just taking our time from us. I’m so frustrated. I grew up here. It’s disappointing but I’m going to have to find somewhere else to bowl.",

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that cleanliness and professionalism are completely absent here. The bathroom was filthy, reeking of neglect and lacking basic hygiene. The lane we were assigned to was sticky, broken, and clearly hadn’t been cleaned in ages. Disgusting doesn’t even begin to cover it.\n\nNow let’s talk about the so-called “server” Heather. I’ve been to many establishments and dealt with all kinds of staff, but Heather is hands down the rudest person I’ve ever encountered in a customer-facing role. She was dismissive, hostile, and completely unprofessional. It’s baffling how someone with experience in hospitality could treat paying customers with such blatant disrespect. Heather does NOT deserve to work with the public. Her attitude was appalling, and she made what should have been a fun outing feel hostile and uncomfortable.\n\nAs for the manager—if you can even call him that—he didn’t intervene once, even after the interaction was clearly escalating. In fact, it was obvious he was under the influence—high as hell, slurring his words and completely unbothered by the chaos happening under his watch. He is not management material in the slightest. The lack of accountability and professionalism is beyond belief.\n\nThis place should be ashamed. The staff needs serious retraining—or replacing entirely. Until major changes are made, avoid this place at all costs. You’re better off staying home than subjecting yourself to this disaster.",
